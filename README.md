Lead Scoring Case Study

Logistic regression machine learning model for Lead Scoring Case Study

There is an education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. When people browse to the website, they might go through the courses or fill up a form for the course if they are interested in it or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. The company also gets leads from referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.

So X Education has appointed us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires wants us to build a model where we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has asked us to reach a lead conversion rate of 80%.
